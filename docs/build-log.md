53 rounds over 45 tasks: a mean of 1.2. Found by review 23, tests 17, the commit check 2, real runs 11.

Four of the problems no test could have caught: a deploy that left out modules, a page buried by 26 repeated warnings, a wrong import, and a worker that weakened a security test while editing nearby lines.

This is one small project. These numbers show how this work went. They are not a benchmark.

Add one row for each new task.
